TAG:HISTORY
The walk to Port Blacksand takes you west some 
fifty miles across plains and over hills; fortunately 
without any harmful encounters. Eventually you 
reach the coast and see the high city wall surrounding 
Port Blacksand and the Cluster Of buildings 
projecting into the sea like an ugly black mark. Ships 
lie anchored in the harbour and smoke rises gently 
from chimneys. It looks peaceful enough and it is 
only when the wind changes that you smell the 
decay in the breeze to remind you of the evil nature 
of this notorious place. Following the dusty road 
north along the coast to the city gates, you begin to 
notice fearful warnings — skulls on wooden spikes, 
starving men in iron cages suspended from the city 
wall and black flags everywhere. As you approach 
the main gate a chill runs down your spine and you 
instinctively grip the hilt of your broadsword for 
reassurance. At the gate you are confronted by a tall 
guard wearing a black chainmail coat and iron helmet. 
He steps forward, barring the way with his 
pike, saying, 'Who would enter port Blacksand 
uninvited? State the nature of your business or go 
back the way you came.' Will you:

TAG:HISTORY
You remove the bracelet from your wrist and toss it at the 
monster.It lands on its annour-like shell and sticks to it 
like glue. You then watch as the bracelet starts to burn its
way through the Shell into the body of the Giant Centipede. 
Smoke rises from the neat round hole and as the bracelet
burns deeper you can see from the frantic movements of the 
Centipede that it its death throes. Finally it is still and 
you manage to squeeze yourself between its body and the roof
of the tunnel. You walk further down the tunnel, which ends 
at an iron grill through which the sewage runs.

bare-chested man wearing a grubby white apron busy at work at
an open tire. He takes a red-hot iron bar from the fire with 
his gloved hand and starts to hammer it into the shape of a 
horseshoe on his anvil. Sweat pours from his brow as he

TAG:DESTINATION: 296
TAG:HISTORY
You sheathe your sword and look round at the circle of 
spectators. Having witnessed your excellent swordsmanship 
each goes quietly back to his table, not wishing to anger you 
any further. The innkeeper apologizes for his unfriendliness 
and invites you to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink at his 
expense. You ask him if he knows the whereabouts of Nicodemus. 
The innkeeper frowns and looks at you inquiringly. Then he 
says,'I don't know what you want from that wily old wizard. He 
keeps himself to himself and lives alone in a small hut under 
Singing Bridge. Keep walking north along Market Street, through the 
market-place, and you'll come to a bridge that crosses Catfish 
River and leads to the old part of the city and the harbour. 
Nicodemus won't talk to you and he knows enough magic to keep 
even the toughest away from his door.' You tell innkeeper not
to be discourteous to strangers next time, and leave the 
tavern to head north.

and a skullcap is standing in  corner. He smiles and asks you
to sit down at the table. He sits opposite you and, after 
placing six white pills on top of six skulls on the table, 
looks up to you and says, 'One of the pills before you is 
deadly poisonous, the others are harmless. Swallow one of 
your choice. If you live, I give you 20 Gold Pieces. If you 
die, I keep all your possessions.'

Ahead you see a wooden bridge stretching over a dirty river. 
Various bits of rubbish are floating to the sea on its black 
surface, and you squirm at the sight of a human hand passing by.
The bridge supports and columns reach high above and you see 
skulls,both human and non-human, tied to them. The wind makes 
an eerie noise as it whistles through the bridge structures, 
reminding you of tortured souls crying out for help. Almost 
hidden from view is a small flight of steps going down 
underneath the bridge from where you are standing. A one-legged 
man carrying a sack is crossing the bridge from the northern bank.

TAG:HISTORY
Following Nicodemus's map, you start your long walk north to 
the guarded tower of Zanbar Bone, the Night Prince. You walk 
through woods and fields. You are able to relax a little in 
the pleasant countryside and breathe the fresh air with its 
wonderful scents. As the light fades you decide to camp under
a huge elm tree. You cook a meal of stewed rabbit and mushrooms
before settling down to a long, deep sleep (add 2 STAMINA points).
In the morning you look around for a yew tree and cut a branch
from it with which you make a bow to fire the silver arrow. As
you test the bow for accuracy, you are suddenly aware of a 
white dove sitting on a low branch near by. There is a small 
piece of paper attached to its foot which it lets you remove 
without flying off. There is a message on the paper which 
reads:

Dear Friend, 
l am afraid I must be getting old to be of use to anybody. I 
regret that I have misinformed you about the compound needed 
to kill Zanbar Bone. You must use only two of the three 
ingredients I told you, but cannot remember which two. I can 
only suggest you try Hag's hair and black pearls together, or
the Hag's hair and lotus flower together, or the black pearls
and lotus flower together. Apologies. 
Good luck,
N.

You throw the message on the ground and curse. You change 
your mind a dozen times before making a decision. Finally 
you make your choice, and grind the two ingredients together
on a flat stone. You place the compound in a leather pouch,
hoping you have made the correct decision. You set off again,
but it is not long before your surroundings become less 
welcoming, the trees are twisted or stunted and there are no
birds to be heard — you must be approaching the domain of the
Night prince. Suddenly to your left you hear rustling and 
grunting in the bushes. It is a wandering monster which has 
been atracted by your scent. Roll one die and consult the table
below to see what creature has appeared. Fight this creature 
as usual.

surprised when they each grab hold of one of your arms. The 
guard with the pike looks up to the sky and laughs, saying, 
'So you want to see Nicodemus, do you? How would you like to 
see the inside of a dungeon cell instead? Guards, take this 
fool away to be shackled, and throw away the key.' Will you:

Behind you comes the sound of running feet. You look round and
see a group of town guards chasing after you. As you stop to think
where to run next, a boy runs out of a house and shouts, 
'Follow me!' You have no better plan in minds so you run after
him. The boy races down to the bottom of Mill Street and turns
left into Goose Street. He stops at a cart laden with hay and
starts to talk frantically to a kind-faced old man, saying, 
'Uncle! uncle! This brave person killed Sourbelly. We must 
help him to escape.' The old man speaks calmly to the boy, 
saying, 'Indeed we owe our friend a favour. Quick, jump into 
the cart.' You climb into the cart and cover yourself with hay. 
You lie completely motionless as you hear the running guards 
approach. They stop to speak to the old thatcher, but he sends 
them running off down Goose Street. After they are gone he 
whispers to you that he will take you to safety. You hear him
climb on to the cart and urge his horse into a slow trot. The
cart bounces noisily along the cobbled street but you feel 
comfortable in the hay. The cart stops and starts a few times,
and you hear questioning voices. About half an hour the cart 
stops again and the thatcher calls out, 'You can come out now.'
You poke your head out of the hay and are surprised to see that
you are on the edge of a wood. To the west you see the daunting
shape of Port Blacksand. You jump out of the cart and thank the
thatcher for his trouble. He says goodbye to you and wheels 
his cart round to return to Port Blacksand. Do you have all the 
items requited to slay the Night Prince, and have you been 
tattooed?

the door. You hear muttering and the shuffling of feet and 
suddenly the door is thrown open. Before you stands a white-haired 
old man with a long beard, wearing long white robes. He looks
at you sternly and says, 'Explain yourself to Nicodemus.' You
are elated at finding Nicodemus and tell him about Zanbar Bone's 
reign of terror in the town of Silverton and why Owen Carralif
asked you to find his old friend to help them. Nicodemus 
frowns and walks back inside his hut, telling you to follow 
him. He sits in a rocking chair and starts to speak in a calm
voice. 'I am old and tired and wish for no more adventure.
I live here under Singing Bridge in Port Biacksand to escape
the pleas for aid from people fallen hard times. Hence no one
bothers me. But I do wish to help my old friend Owen. I will
tell you how to defeat the Night Prince, Zanbar Bone. Listen
carefully. Remember, you defeat him only after sunset. In daylight
hours he exists on another plane. No doubt he will have his 
servants to protect him, but should you get past them, you 
will need something special to deal with Bone himself. To 
protect yourself from his entrancing stare, you must have a 
white unicorn in a yellow sun tattooed on your forehead. 
Normal weapons will not harm him. First, you must shoot him
through the heart with a silver arrow. This will paralyse
him but not kill him. Then you must quickly rub the ground 
compound of black pearl, Hag's hair and a lotus flower in his 
open eyes. With luck, he will decay before you in seconds. If
your arrow misses, I'm afraid you will die the moment he touches
you. The items for the compourd can all he found in Port 
Blacksand if you search hard enough. I regret I cannot 
accompany you.' Nicodemus then draws you a map of how to reach
Zanbar Bone's guarded tower from Port Blacksand. He stands up, 
shakes your hand and wishes you well. You leave his hut, climb 
the steps and cross the bridge over Catfish River. Bridge Street
continues north a short distance before ending at a junction.

TAG:HISTORY
You leave Zanbar Bone's black tower as quickly as you can, not 
wishing to spend another moment in the infernal place. Before
leaving, however, you set it alight so that no evil entity may
ever again use it for foul deeds. You sleep the rest of the
night and long into the next morning in a hayfield, before 
setting off for Silverton in the afternoon. Battleweary and 
hungry, you arrive in Silverton the same evening. You are given
a hero's welcome and gift after gift is bestowed upon you. A 
feast is arranged and there is laughter, music and drinking in
all the streets. Finally, Owen Carralif makes a speech and 
presents you with a gold orb worth hundreds of Gold Pieces. 
The people of Silverton are joyous once again.
