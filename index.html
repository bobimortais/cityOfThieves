TAG:ACTION 2: 33 
TAG:CHOICE 3: Attack him quickly with your sword
TAG:ACTION 3: 49
TAG:HISTORY The walk to Port Blacksand takes you west some 
fifty miles across plains and over hills; fortunately 
without any harmful encounters. Eventually you 
reach the coast and see the high city wall surrounding 
Port Blacksand and the Cluster Of buildings 
projecting into the sea like an ugly black mark. Ships 
lie anchored in the harbour and smoke rises gently 
from chimneys. It looks peaceful enough and it is 
only when the wind changes that you smell the 
decay in the breeze to remind you of the evil nature 
of this notorious place. Following the dusty road 
north along the coast to the city gates, you begin to 
notice fearful warnings — skulls on wooden spikes, 
starving men in iron cages suspended from the city 
wall and black flags everywhere. As you approach 
the main gate a chill runs down your spine and you 
instinctively grip the hilt of your broadsword for 
reassurance. At the gate you are confronted by a tall 
guard wearing a black chainmail coat and iron helmet. 
He steps forward, barring the way with his 
pike, saying, 'Who would enter port Blacksand 
uninvited? State the nature of your business or go 
back the way you came.' Will you:

TAG:HISTORY You remove the bracelet from your wrist and toss it at the 
monster.It lands on its annour-like shell and sticks to it 
like glue. You then watch as the bracelet starts to burn its
way through the Shell into the body of the Giant Centipede. 
Smoke rises from the neat round hole and as the bracelet
burns deeper you can see from the frantic movements of the 
Centipede that it its death throes. Finally it is still and 
you manage to squeeze yourself between its body and the roof
of the tunnel. You walk further down the tunnel, which ends 
at an iron grill through which the sewage runs.

need such things. You press the blade of your sword against
his fat neck to make sure he is not lying. He looks terrified
and assures you that he is telling the truth. Then he says, 
'But I do know where you can get a silver arrow. Ben Borryman
the silversmith will make anything in silver at a price. You 
will find him in Clog Street.' Making a mental note of the 
information you leave the shivering captain alone in his room,
locking the door behind you. Outside in the corridor you may

TAG:CHOICE 1: If you win
TAG:ACTION 1: 138
TAG:HISTORY Following Nicodemus's map, you start your long walk north to 
the guarded tower of Zanbar Bone, the Night Prince. You walk 
through woods and fields. You are able to relax a little in 
the pleasant countryside and breathe the fresh air with its 
wonderful scents. As the light fades you decide to camp under
a huge elm tree. You cook a meal of stewed rabbit and mushrooms
before settling down to a long, deep sleep (add 2 STAMINA points).
In the morning you look around for a yew tree and cut a branch
from it with which you make a bow to fire the silver arrow. As
you test the bow for accuracy, you are suddenly aware of a 
white dove sitting on a low branch near by. There is a small 
piece of paper attached to its foot which it lets you remove 
without flying off. There is a message on the paper which 
reads:

Dear Friend, 
l am afraid I must be getting old to be of use to anybody. I 
regret that I have misinformed you about the compound needed 
to kill Zanbar Bone. You must use only two of the three 
ingredients I told you, but cannot remember which two. I can 
only suggest you try Hag's hair and black pearls together, or
the Hag's hair and lotus flower together, or the black pearls
and lotus flower together. Apologies. 
Good luck,
N.

You throw the message on the ground and curse. You change 
your mind a dozen times before making a decision. Finally 
you make your choice, and grind the two ingredients together
on a flat stone. You place the compound in a leather pouch,
hoping you have made the correct decision. You set off again,
but it is not long before your surroundings become less 
welcoming, the trees are twisted or stunted and there are no
birds to be heard — you must be approaching the domain of the
Night prince. Suddenly to your left you hear rustling and 
grunting in the bushes. It is a wandering monster which has 
been atracted by your scent. Roll one die and consult the table
below to see what creature has appeared. Fight this creature 
as usual.

other guards come running out of the house, and you are 
surprised when they each grab hold of one of your arms. The 
guard with the pike looks up to the sky and laughs, saying, 
'So you want to see Nicodemus, do you? How would you like to 
see the inside of a dungeon cell instead? Guards, take this 
fool away to be shackled, and throw away the key.' Will you:

see a group of town guards chasing after you. As you stop to think
where to run next, a boy runs out of a house and shouts, 
'Follow me!' You have no better plan in minds so you run after
him. The boy races down to the bottom of Mill Street and turns
left into Goose Street. He stops at a cart laden with hay and
starts to talk frantically to a kind-faced old man, saying, 
'Uncle! uncle! This brave person killed Sourbelly. We must 
help him to escape.' The old man speaks calmly to the boy, 
saying, 'Indeed we owe our friend a favour. Quick, jump into 
the cart.' You climb into the cart and cover yourself with hay. 
You lie completely motionless as you hear the running guards 
approach. They stop to speak to the old thatcher, but he sends 
them running off down Goose Street. After they are gone he 
whispers to you that he will take you to safety. You hear him
climb on to the cart and urge his horse into a slow trot. The
cart bounces noisily along the cobbled street but you feel 
comfortable in the hay. The cart stops and starts a few times,
and you hear questioning voices. About half an hour the cart 
stops again and the thatcher calls out, 'You can come out now.'
You poke your head out of the hay and are surprised to see that
you are on the edge of a wood. To the west you see the daunting
shape of Port Blacksand. You jump out of the cart and thank the
thatcher for his trouble. He says goodbye to you and wheels 
his cart round to return to Port Blacksand. Do you have all the 
items requited to slay the Night Prince, and have you been 
tattooed?

TAG:HISTORY The smell by the water's edge is terrible. Above, you hear the
sound of footsteps crossing the wooden bridge. Built into the 
foundations of the bridge is a wooden hut. Drawn curtains 
obstruct your view into the hut but you know you are not 
welcome when you read the words 'Keep Out' painted on the door 
in large red letters. You draw in a deep breath and knock on 
the door. You hear muttering and the shuffling of feet and 
suddenly the door is thrown open. Before you stands a white-haired 
old man with a long beard, wearing long white robes. He looks
at you sternly and says, 'Explain yourself to Nicodemus.' You
are elated at finding Nicodemus and tell him about Zanbar Bone's 
reign of terror in the town of Silverton and why Owen Carralif
asked you to find his old friend to help them. Nicodemus 
frowns and walks back inside his hut, telling you to follow 
him. He sits in a rocking chair and starts to speak in a calm
voice. 'I am old and tired and wish for no more adventure.
I live here under Singing Bridge in Port Biacksand to escape
the pleas for aid from people fallen hard times. Hence no one
bothers me. But I do wish to help my old friend Owen. I will
tell you how to defeat the Night Prince, Zanbar Bone. Listen
carefully. Remember, you defeat him only after sunset. In daylight
hours he exists on another plane. No doubt he will have his 
servants to protect him, but should you get past them, you 
will need something special to deal with Bone himself. To 
protect yourself from his entrancing stare, you must have a 
white unicorn in a yellow sun tattooed on your forehead. 
Normal weapons will not harm him. First, you must shoot him
through the heart with a silver arrow. This will paralyse
him but not kill him. Then you must quickly rub the ground 
compound of black pearl, Hag's hair and a lotus flower in his 
open eyes. With luck, he will decay before you in seconds. If
your arrow misses, I'm afraid you will die the moment he touches
you. The items for the compourd can all he found in Port 
Blacksand if you search hard enough. I regret I cannot 
accompany you.' Nicodemus then draws you a map of how to reach
Zanbar Bone's guarded tower from Port Blacksand. He stands up, 
shakes your hand and wishes you well. You leave his hut, climb 
the steps and cross the bridge over Catfish River. Bridge Street
continues north a short distance before ending at a junction.

There are portraits and shields hanging on the walls and a

not welcome strangers. Then she looks away from the crystal

topiary - each shrub has been cut into the shape of an animal - 
and you decide to take a closer look. The path leads into a 
paved area surrounded the by animal-shaped shrubs. In the 
middle there is a stone plinth upon which sits a large earthen
bowl containing lotus flowers! There is a painted sign which
