HISTORY
As you slide your hand into the glove, it seems to come alive
and cling tightly to your hand. Then it changes texture and 
becomes hot and you feel as though your hand is covered with 
burning tar  which you are unable to shake off. Mercifully it
cools down, but a thin white film remains on your hand,
making it difficult to open and close. Lose 2 SKILL points.
