HISTORY
At the end of the market, a Street named Bridge Street runs 
north out of the square. You decide to walk down it in the 
hope of finding the elusive Nicodemus. It starts to rain and 
the tumbledown houses huddled together on either side of the 
street look as if they need shelter themselves. Most have 
their windows boarded up and are empty. The door to one flaps 
noisily in the wind.
