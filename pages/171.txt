HISTORY
The street gradually starts to run downhill. The houses end at
a tavern called the Black Lobster and the street opens out on 
to a quayside. A stone jetty runs out to sea and tied to it 
is an old galleon. It is flying the skull and crossbones and 
is probably one of the many pirate ships that anchor in Port 
Blacksand to off-load their booty. Harbour Street turns right
at the jetty and runs north parallel to the shore as far as 
you can see.
