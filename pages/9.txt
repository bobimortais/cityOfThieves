HISTORY
You step back from the vile body of Zanbar Bone, waiting for 
him to decay. However, you have chosen wrongly! He pulls the
arrow from his chest and rubs the compound from his eyes. He 
sees you and laughs. You are mesmerized by his power and are 
unable to move. He walks up to you and touches your face with
his skeletal fingers. Your life is draining quickly away and 
you soon begin your undead existence as a servant of Zanbar Bone.
