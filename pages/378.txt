HISTORY
Roll one die alternately for yourself and the bare-chested
man, to represent the cannon ball passing between you. Repeat
this process until a 1 is thrown, in which case the cannon ball
have been dropped and the loser must pay the winner 5 Gold 
Pieces. After finishing the game you walk on a bit further.
