HISTORY
The Elf leads you into a room lit by purple candles, which 
a strange glow. You stand and stare blankly at the candles and
drift off into a world of vivid dreams. While you are in this
trance, the Elf takes two items and 5 Gold Pieces from your 
backpack (if you have them). When you awake, you have no 
recollection of the theft and leave the shop thanking the Elf
for showing you his beautiful candles.
