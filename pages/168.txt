TEST: SKILL
SUCESS: If the number rolled is equal to or less than your SKILL score, you hit the ball powerfully in the middle of the bat and watch it soar over the wall.
DESTINATION: 359
FAIL: If the number rolled is greater than your SKILL score, the ball goes whistling by your midriff as you swing, and a voice behind you calls, 'You're out!'.
DESTINATION: 266
HISTORY
The Bays have difficulty in explaining themselves, but you 
manage to understand that one of the other team is going to 
throw the ball at you. You are handed the wooden stick and 
told that if you hit the ball over the wall, you will win the
game for them. Roll two dice.
