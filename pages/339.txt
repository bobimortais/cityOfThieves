HISTORY
The man looks atyou and smiles, saying, 'We do not get many 
visitors in these parts, but I am sure my master would wish 
you to have a room for the night. Do come in.' He steps back 
and you follow him into a beautiful marble-noored hallway. 
There are portraits and shields hanging on the walls and a 
spiral staircase leads up to the floor above. He asks you to 
follow him up the staircase and offers to carry your backpack
for you, which you allow him to do. You can see that the 
staircase winds its way all the way up to the top of the tower,
but the man steps off at the first floor and walks along the 
landing to a door. He opens it and walks into a large room,
placing your backpack on a made-up bed. He tells you that this
is your room for the night and walks out, telling you that you
will meet his master at breakfast.
