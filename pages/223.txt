HISTORY
Sweat breaks out on your forehead - you choose a pill and 
swallow it. Roll one die. If you roll any number 2 and 6, you
have chosen a harmless pill. The man reaches into a pouch on
his cord belt and hands you 20 Gold Pieces. He then bids you
farewell and tells you to come back soon. You leave the room
and walk back up the alley to Candle Street. A roll of 1 means
you die quickly from the poisoned pill and your adventure ends here.
