HISTORY
You pay for the smoking mixture and leave the shop. Outside you
pack your pipe with the smoking mixture and light it. The 
smoke is dark and tastes awful. You start to cough and your 
chest is gripped by a terrible pain. Lose 2 STAMINA points. You 
are unable to stop coughing, so you sit down on the street and 
try to calm down. You slump down against a wall between two 
barrels and gradually the coughing subsides.
