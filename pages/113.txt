You enter the house and find yourself standing ina room full 
of toys. But they are not ordinary toys. These are stuffed 
creatures with nails through their heads, dolls' houses that 
are made to look as if they are on fire, and many other 
unpleasant objects. In the middle of the room stand two old 
women dressed as thOL1gh they were little girls. They are 
squatbling over a carved wooden duck. Each looks eager to 
destroy the duck with the knives they are holding. On seeing 
you the women both start to shout, 'Give us toys! Give us 
toys!'
