HISTORY
It is gloomy in the house but you can make out the shapes of 
abandoned furniture. Litter and rubble is strewn all over the
floor. You find a broken chair and slump down in it rest.
Suddenly you notice something slither across the floor, and 
before you get to your feet you see in the half-light that you
are encircled by six snakes, each a metre long.
