HISTORY
All the bays on your side rush over to you and slap your hands
with theirs. They are overjoyed at their victory. Supporters
run over and start handing you gifts. Eventually you manage 
to wriggle free from your admirers and find a place to sit down 
to inspect your gifts. You have been given 8 Gold Pieces, a 
bottle containing a clear liquid labelled 'Potion of Mind Control',
a silver flute, a bunch of  bananas, a piece of chalk and an 
eye-patch. You eat the bananas (add 2 STAMINA points) and 
place the rest of the items in your backpack. You climb back 
the wall before the Bays start another game, walk back to the
junction and head west along Harbour Street.
