HISTORY
From the top of the wall you see that it encircles a group 
of brown creatures playing some kind of game with a wooden 
stick and a small leather ball. One of the creatures has just
hit the ball and is running towards a creature from the other
team who has his foot on a cloth bag. You realize that these 
creatures are Bays playing their favourite game, Bays' Ball.
