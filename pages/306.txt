HISTORY
The two guards look at each other in horror and run out of the
cell up the stairs, screaming 'Plague!' at the top of their 
voices. Smilling to yourself you walk calmly out of the cell
and pick up your sword off the table. Upstairs you find that
the guards have fled;a search of the room reveals 2 Gold Pieces 
and a merchant's pass to trade in Port Blacksand. Taking your
findings, move over to the door and creep outside into the 
city.
