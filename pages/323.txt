HISTORY
The blacksmith looks surprised at your unprovoked aggression 
and pulls another red-hot iron bar from the fire with his 
gloved hand. He is very angry and lunges at you with the bar.
If the blacksmith wounds you during any Attack Round, you must
subtract 3 points from your STAMINA score because of the bum 
caused by the iron bar.
