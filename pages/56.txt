GAMEOVER
HISTORY
There are over twenty guards coming to get you and is useless 
to put up a fight. They drag you off to a room at the bottom 
of the tower and chain you to a wall. To your horror you see
the two Trolls enter the room. They take it in turns to beat 
you before passing a sentence of five years' solitary 
confinement in a dungeon cell. A few minutes later a 
hunchbacked jailer arrives carrying a bull-hide whip. He fixes
a ball and chain to your leg before leading you downstairs to
begin your jail sentence. You have failed in your mission.
