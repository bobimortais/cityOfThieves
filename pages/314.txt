HISTORY
You sit down to rest and plan what to do next. As you slump 
down on the cold stone floor, you inadvertently knock over a 
glass jar you hadn't seen  before, which rolls against the wall
and shatters. From the broken jar a small man some fifteen 
centimetres high steps out and walks over to you. He looks up 
at you with his hands on his hips and in a barely audible voice
says, 'Thank you very much. I've been trapped in that infernal
jar for the last hundred years. Now how can I repay you?'
