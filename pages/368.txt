HISTORY
Look into a crystal ball, she seems to go into a trance. She 
tells you that you are searching for a man, a wise man with 
magical powers. She pauses for a moment and then draws in a 
deep breath before going on to tell you that the man you are
looking for lives in a hut beneath a bridge to the north. She
warns you to be careful when approaching the man, for he does
not welcome strangers. Then she looks away from the crystal 
ball and asks you to leave. Her face seems to be hiding 
something. Has she seen some dreadful fate awaiting you?
You decide to leave the tent and head north.
