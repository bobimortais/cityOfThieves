TEST: LUCK
SUCESS: If you are Lucky, the arrow finds its mark and pierces the Night Prince through his robed chest.
DESTINATION: 244
FAIL: If you are Unlucky, the  arrow misses the Night Prince and he advances to touch your arm. His skeletal fingers are draining your life away. You are now one of his undead Servants.
DESTINATION: GAMEOVER
Zanbar Bone walks towards you, trying to touch your exposed 
skin. You throw down your sword and notch the silver arrow to
your bow. You have only one chance.  You take aim and release
the  string. Test your Luck.
