HISTORY
Inside the shop you see a tall, thin man with pointed ears 
and fair hair, pouringhot wax from an pan into a mould. The 
candle-maker is an Elf, As he turns to you to speak, you 
notice his slanted eyes, which are ice blue. For some reason 
they appear very cold to you. He tells you that all his coloured
candles cost 1 Gold Piece each. You may buy as many as you wish.
He then asks you if you would like to see one of his magic 
candles in the back room.
