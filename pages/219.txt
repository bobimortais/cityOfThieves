HISTORY
The larger of the two Trolls tells you that his name is 
Sourbelly and it is his duty to track down unwelcome visitors 
to Port Blacksand. He looks at the pass and says, 'You don't 
look much like a merchant to me. Are you one of those fancy 
folk who have been attending the spice sales in Pepper Street?'
