STATUS 1: STAMINA;DECREASE;3
DESTINATION: 30
HISTORY
Lose 3 STAMINA points. If you are still alive you manage with
great pain to pull the bolt from your shoulder. As you bandage
your wound the little man runs off into the building on your 
left. There does not appear to be an easy way to catch him so
you walk under the bridge and continue east.
