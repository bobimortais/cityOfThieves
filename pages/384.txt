HISTORY
As the cudgel swings through the air above your head, you punch 
the Dwarf holding it. He lets out a scream and drops the cudgel.
Feeling his bleeding nose and seeing the blood on his hand, 
he screams again and runs off down the alley. The other two
Dwarfs holding your legs realize that you are not a easy victim
and run off after their fellow-robber.
