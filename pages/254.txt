HISTORY
A horrified look spreads across the Vampire's face when she 
sees the clove of garlic in your hand. She retreats into a 
corner of the room trying to escape the pungent smell, which 
negates her blood-sucking powers. You back out of the room 
taking the key to the door with you, and lock it from the 
outside.
