HISTORY
Stepping over the Fire Imp, you walk back to the stairs to see
if its master is still in the house. You descend the stairs 
slowly, sword drawn. When you reach the bottom you are somewhat
surprised to see a fat man, richly dressed, sitting in an 
ornate chair looking directly at you. He appears very relaxed,
quite unperturbed by your drawn sword. Then he speaks, slowly
and coldly, saying, 'For killing my pet you shall pay with 
your life.' He raises his right hand in the air and from his 
outstretched fingers shoot ragged white bolts Of lightning.
