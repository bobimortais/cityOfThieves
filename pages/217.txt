HISTORY
You walk all day until you reach the hill shown on Nicodemus'
map upon which the Night Prince's tower stands. All is quiet
and there is an unpleasant smell of decay in the air. Shadows
start to creep along the ground as the moon rises into the
night sky and you see the foreboding silhouetted shap of
Zanbar Bone's tower pointing up into the sky like a black
finger. You check all your possessions before drawing your
sword and marching towards the arched wooden entrance door.
Suddenly you hear a shrill howl and swing round to see two
pairs of eyes staring at you. They belong to MOON DOGS. 
Zanbar Bone's trained killer hounds. Fight them one at a time.
