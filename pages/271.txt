HISTORY
Asleep in their bunks are three pirates. Their room is small 
and contains only clothing and a few personal possessions. It
looks as if the pirates have been drinking and gambling - there
is an uncorked bottle of rum, a mug and a pack of cards on top
of a barrel in the centre of the room. You see that one of the
pirates is wearing a small leather pouch around his neck.
