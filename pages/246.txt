HISTORY
As you walk warily down the narrow cobbled street, you are 
suddenly confronted by a little old man who dashes out of one
of the houses. He pulls a dirty bottle out of a canvas bag. As
he speaks, you can't help staring at the large wart on his nose,
with its tuft of hair. He smiles and asks if you would like to
pay 2 Gold Pieces for a drink of his wonderful healing potion.
