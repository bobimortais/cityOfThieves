HISTORY
The Dwarf explains that they are playing a simple winner-takes-all
dice game. The stakes are 2 Gold Pieces. Each person will 
stake 2 Gold Pieces and roll two dice. The person rolling the
highest number collects the 8 Gold Pieces. To play, roll two 
dice three times for the three Dwarfs and make a note of each
total. Next, roll two dice for yourself. If your own total is
higher than each of the other three totals, you win 6 Gold 
Pieces from the Dwarfs. If the total is less than any of the 
other three totals, you lose 2 Gold Pieces. You may play four 
times if you wish to before the Dwarfs get bored and leave the
tavern.
