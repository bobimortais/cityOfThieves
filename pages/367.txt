HISTORY
The Trolls watch carefully as you open your backpack. You give
them all your gold except for 1 Gold Piece which you manage to 
palm without their noticing. They then place themselves on 
either side of you and march you along Mill Street until you 
reach the city'S North Gate at the junction with Goose Street. 
They tell the two guards on duty not to let you back into 
Port Blacksand. They give you a forceful boot up the backside
and you land sprawling on the dusty road outside. 
Do you have all the  items required to slay the Night Prince,
and have you been tattooed?
