HISTORY
The silk curtains in front of the archway are pulled aside 
and a strange creature steps into the room. It has a snake's 
head, which sits oddly on the shoulders of a young woman 
wearing a lavish gown. Its mouth opens and a forked tongue 
darts in and out as the Serpent Queen starts to accuse you, 
shouting, 'I ordered no flowers from Mrs Pipe, and she 
certainly would not send any as a gift, What trickery is this, 
rogue?' You start to panic, deciding what to do next.
