HISTORY
Walking towards you down the street are two men wearing black
robes which cover them completely except for their eyes. On 
seeing you they nod at each other and draw their swords; they 
are THIEVES hoping to rob you of your possessions and you must
defend yourself. Fight them one at a time.
