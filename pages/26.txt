HISTORY
You sheathe your sword and look round at the circle of 
spectators. Having witnessed your excellent swordsmanship 
each goes quietly back to his table, not wishing to anger you 
any further. The innkeeper apologizes for his unfriendliness 
and invites you to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink at his 
expense. You ask him if he knows the whereabouts of Nicodemus. 
The innkeeper frowns and looks at you inquiringly. Then he 
says,'I don't know what you want from that wily old wizard. He 
keeps himself to himself and lives alone in a small hut under 
Singing Bridge. Keep walking north along Market Street, through the 
market-place, and you'll come to a bridge that crosses Catfish 
River and leads to the old part of the city and the harbour. 
Nicodemus won't talk to you and he knows enough magic to keep 
even the toughest away from his door.' You tell innkeeper not
to be discourteous to strangers next time, and leave the 
tavern to head north.
