HISTORY
The alley is narrow and dark and runs south some twenty metres
before to a dead end at a wall. The Dwarfs are nowhere to be 
seen. You start walking slowly back up the alley when suddenly
a net falls on you from above. It is weighted and you stumble 
to the ground, completely entangled. Then you become aware of
the three Dwarfs standing above you, chuckling to themselves. 
Their hands reach through the netting and you watch helplessly
as they rummage through your backpack. They seem interested 
only in your gold. Eventually they walk off and leave you to  
wriggle free. You have lost all your gold. Lose 2 LUCK points.
