HISTORY
The silk curtains in front of the archway are pulled aside 
and a strange creature steps into the room. It has a snake's 
head, which sits oddly atop the body of a young woman wearing
a lavish gown. Its mouth opens and a forked tongue darts in 
and out as the Serpent Queen says, 'Don't try to fool me, 
I know that scoundrel Barryman never sends flowers. What 
silver gift have you brought me?'
