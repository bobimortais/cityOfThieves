HISTORY
Nobody spends a night asleep at Zanbar Bone tower and lives. In
the middle of the night a jet of gas, which poisons you almost
immediately, is released from the headboard on the bed. Then 
Zanbar Bone's witches and servants raise you into an undead 
world in which you will serve for ever as a Spirit Stalker.
