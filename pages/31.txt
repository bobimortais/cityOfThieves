HISTORY
Ahead you see a wooden bridge stretching over a dirty river. 
Various bits of rubbish are floating to the sea on its black 
surface, and you squirm at the sight of a human hand passing by.
The bridge supports and columns reach high above and you see 
skulls,both human and non-human, tied to them. The wind makes 
an eerie noise as it whistles through the bridge structures, 
reminding you of tortured souls crying out for help. Almost 
hidden from view is a small flight of steps going down 
underneath the bridge from where you are standing. A one-legged 
man carrying a sack is crossing the bridge from the northern bank.
