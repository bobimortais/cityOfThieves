HISTORY
The blacksmith removes his gloves and wipes his hands on his 
apron before asking you what you want. You answer by asking 
if he makes anything besides horseshoes. He replies that in 
his spare time he enjoys making chaimail coats. In fact it has 
become quite a profitable sideline of his, especially in a 
place like Port Blacksand. He tells yau in great detail of the
