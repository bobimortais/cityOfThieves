HISTORY
The Troll bursts out laughing and says, 'Fooled you! There 
isn't a Pepper Street in Port Blacksand!' His face folds into
a sickly grin and he tells you that you are under arrest for 
being in Port Blacksand without authorization. He tells you 
that he is feeling generous, however, and offers you a choice.
You can pay a fine of all the gold in your backpack and be 
thrown out of the city, or spend a year with rats and 
cockroaches in a dirty dungeon cell. The other Troll bursts 
out laughing, saying, 'Generous? Ho! Ho!  Ho! Ah, Sourbelly, 
you've got such a sense of humour!"
