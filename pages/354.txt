HISTORY
The tattooist looks at you with a bored expression on his face
and says, 'Well, you don't expect me to do it for free, 
do you? If you've got anything worth selling, go next door. 
My step-brother lives there and he's a pawnbroker. Tell him I
sent you and maybe he'll give you a good price.' You walk 
outside and knock on the wooden door of the next house. A 
squint-eyed man opens the door and you tell him that you want
to sell some items so that you can afford to have a tattoo. The 
man asks you to come into his house and you enter a room piled 
high with all kinds of objects, furniture, armour, curios and
pottery. He explains that he has a stall in the market which
he rents once a week. He then tells you what he is currently 
interested in buying, and the prices he is offering:
Silver goblet 	        8 Gold Pieces
Skeleton key	       15 Gold Pieces
Scorpion brooch	       10 Gold Pieces
Magic ring	           12 Gold Pieces
Silver bracelet	        5 Gold Pieces
Helmet	                7 Gold Pieces
Silver flute	        5 Gold Pieces
Eye-patch	            1 Gold Piece
Knucklebones          	1 Gold Piece
Mirror	                1 Gold Piece 
You may sell the pawnbroker any of your passessions. You bid 
him farewell and walkoutside.
