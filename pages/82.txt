HISTORY
Before the Hag can complete her spell, you reach into your 
backpack and take out the bottle containing the potion. You 
gulp down the liquid and feel its effects immediately. The Hag
is still mouthing her vile sorcery but you cannot hear her. 
Safe from her evil, you draw your sword and step forward. You
grab hold of her matted hair and cut a clump from her head. 
She writhes and kicks and spits at you. At this close range 
you can see fresh blood on her face - no doubt she could not
wait to cook some of the rats she had killed. Despite your
repulsion you are excited about having gained one of the items
necessary to defeat the Night Prince.
