HISTORY
You tell the man that cannot pay the price he is  asking. He 
shrugs his shoulders and says, 'Well, do you have any food?' 
You open your backpack and he takes all your remaining 
Provisions. He then starts to cast the silver arrow and you
wait patiently as he makes it. Finally he presents you with 
it and assures you that it will be accurate in fight. You 
thank him for his trouble and leave his shop.
