HISTORY
When you draw your sword the man cries out and runs into a 
back room. You follow him into the room. He is apparently 
unarmed, but is holding an egg and a small key in his hands. 
He warns you that the egg contains a deadly gas and he will 
throw it at you. He also threatens to swallow the key to his 
silver cupboard.
