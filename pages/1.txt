HISTORY
The walk to Port Blacksand takes you west some 
fifty miles across plains and over hills; fortunately 
without any harmful encounters. Eventually you 
reach the coast and see the high city wall surrounding 
Port Blacksand and the Cluster Of buildings 
projecting into the sea like an ugly black mark. Ships 
lie anchored in the harbour and smoke rises gently 
from chimneys. It looks peaceful enough and it is 
only when the wind changes that you smell the 
decay in the breeze to remind you of the evil nature 
of this notorious place. Following the dusty road 
north along the coast to the city gates, you begin to 
notice fearful warnings â€” skulls on wooden spikes, 
starving men in iron cages suspended from the city 
wall and black flags everywhere. As you approach 
the main gate a chill runs down your spine and you 
instinctively grip the hilt of your broadsword for 
reassurance. At the gate you are confronted by a tall 
guard wearing a black chainmail coat and iron helmet. 
He steps forward, barring the way with his 
pike, saying, 'Who would enter port Blacksand 
uninvited? State the nature of your business or go 
back the way you came.' Will you:
