HISTORY
You enter a large room with brown walls and a straw-covered 
floor. There is a musty smell hanging in the air which reminds
you of the dirty old Cave Trolls that live on the northern borders.
In the middle of the room is a table made from half a barrel 
with some roughly made stools round it. A high archway leads 
through the room to the back of the house, from where you hear
a low murmuring voice.
