HISTORY
You can hear some scratching sounds in the tunnel ahead. Then
you see a long shadow appear on the curved brick wall. In the 
dim light you can just make out the large shape of something 
black and shiny moving towards you. The scratching becomes 
louder and you also hear clicking sounds. The monster is only
a couple of metres ahead of when you recognize it as a 
Giant Centipede. Do you possess an insect bracelet?
