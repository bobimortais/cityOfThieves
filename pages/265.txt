HISTORY
With your sword still dripping with the blood of the Rats you
walk further along the tunnel. The ledge you are walking along
is narrow and slippery, and you have to tread carefully so as
not to fall into the slow-flowing sewage channel. The tunnel 
gradually bends round to the right and as you follow it round,
the silence is suddenly shattered by the sound of running feet
and a wailing scream. Coming straight at you, wild-eyed, with
flailing arms and contorted face, uttering demon sorcery, is 
a white-haired old woman dressed in rags. She is a Hag. Do you 
possess a Potion of Mind Control?
