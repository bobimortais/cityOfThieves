HISTORY
The silk curtains in front of the archway are pulled iside and
a strange creature steps into the room. It has a snake's head,
which sits oddly atop the body of a young woman wearing a 
lavish gown. You feel uncomfortable and are undecided whether
or not to draw your sword. Then the snake's mouth opens and a 
forked tongue darts in and out as the Serpent Queen asks to 
see the flowers sent to her by Lord Azzur.
