HISTORY
You lift the lid of the sarcophagus and see a human body 
completely encased in old bandages. The light, although dim,
has disturbed the sleep of a MUMMY, and it sits up, turning its
head from side to side. It senses where you are and starts to 
climb of its sarcophagus. It walks towards you with its arms 
extended.
