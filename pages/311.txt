HISTORY
As you start your fight with the GUARD, you see two more armed
men appear from a stone guardhouse by the gate. They draw their 
swords and await the outcome of your battle. If you defeat the 
first city guard, you must now fight the other two as a pair. 
Both have a separate attack on you in each Attack Round, but 
you must choose which of the two you will fight. Attack your
nominated target as in a normal battle. Against the other you
will throw for Attack Strength in the normal way, but you will
not wound him if your Attack Strength is greater - you must 
just count this as though you have parried his blow. Of course
if his Attack Strength is greater, he will have wounded you in the 
normal way
