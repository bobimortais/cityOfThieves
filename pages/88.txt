HISTORY
You pull back the curtains and walk into a very lavish 
boudoir. In it is a young woman with her back towards you. As
you approach her she spins round and you are stunned to see, 
not the young woman's face you are expecting, but a large 
snake's head. It extends out from the shoulders and bites you
on the neck. You are caught somewhat off-balance by the 
SERPENT QUEEN and suffer the loss of 4 STAMINA points and 1 
SKILL point before you can draw your sword to defend yourself.
