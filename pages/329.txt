HISTORY
The smell by the water's edge is terrible. Above, you hear the
sound of footsteps crossing the wooden bridge. Built into the 
foundations of the bridge is a wooden hut. Drawn curtains 
obstruct your view into the hut but you know you are not 
welcome when you read the words 'Keep Out' painted on the door 
in large red letters. You draw in a deep breath and knock on 
the door. You hear muttering and the shuffling of feet and 
suddenly the door is thrown open. Before you stands a white-haired 
old man with a long beard, wearing long white robes. He looks
at you sternly and says, 'Explain yourself to Nicodemus.' You
are elated at finding Nicodemus and tell him about Zanbar Bone's 
reign of terror in the town of Silverton and why Owen Carralif
asked you to find his old friend to help them. Nicodemus 
frowns and walks back inside his hut, telling you to follow 
him. He sits in a rocking chair and starts to speak in a calm
voice. 'I am old and tired and wish for no more adventure.
I live here under Singing Bridge in Port Biacksand to escape
the pleas for aid from people fallen hard times. Hence no one
bothers me. But I do wish to help my old friend Owen. I will
tell you how to defeat the Night Prince, Zanbar Bone. Listen
carefully. Remember, you defeat him only after sunset. In daylight
hours he exists on another plane. No doubt he will have his 
servants to protect him, but should you get past them, you 
will need something special to deal with Bone himself. To 
protect yourself from his entrancing stare, you must have a 
white unicorn in a yellow sun tattooed on your forehead. 
Normal weapons will not harm him. First, you must shoot him
through the heart with a silver arrow. This will paralyse
him but not kill him. Then you must quickly rub the ground 
compound of black pearl, Hag's hair and a lotus flower in his 
open eyes. With luck, he will decay before you in seconds. If
your arrow misses, I'm afraid you will die the moment he touches
you. The items for the compourd can all he found in Port 
Blacksand if you search hard enough. I regret I cannot 
accompany you.' Nicodemus then draws you a map of how to reach
Zanbar Bone's guarded tower from Port Blacksand. He stands up, 
shakes your hand and wishes you well. You leave his hut, climb 
the steps and cross the bridge over Catfish River. Bridge Street
continues north a short distance before ending at a junction.
