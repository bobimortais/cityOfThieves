HISTORY
The staircase ends at a door. You turn the handle slowly and 
the door opens, much to your surprise, into open air. You walk
outside on to the flat roof of the tower. Suddenly you are 
aware of movement in the sky and look up to see two large 
birds in the moonlight with long beaks and talons swooping 
down on you. There is no time to run for cover, and  you must
fight the DEATH HAWKS.Fight them one at a time.
