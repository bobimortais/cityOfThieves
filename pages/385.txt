HISTORY
A voice in your mind tells you that the chest is an illusion
and does not exist. Also you see that the black cat is not
what you thought it was. Before you stands a black-robed skeleton
with geen, translucid eyes, wearing a golden crown on its skull -
Zanbar Bone! Before you have time to notch your arrow, the Night
Prince pulls three teeth from his mouth and throws them on the
floor. They explode in puffs of smoke and out them step three
SKELETONS armed with swords. Fight them one at a time.
