HISTORY
The blacksmith takes your money and walks over to some bales 
of hay in the corner. He lifts one up and underneath it you 
see the chainmail coat. He turns to you and says, 'You have 
to hide everything in this place. You can't trust anybody.' 
The coat fits perfectly and its workmanship is excellent.
