HISTORY
You draw your sword and stand ready to fight the Trolls. They
seem pleased that you are going to give hem a chance to 
practise their beloved sport of killing humans, and advance 
towards you swinging their battle-axs. Sourbelly snarls and 
says, 'Stand back, Fatnose â€” let deal with this dog alone.' 
Fight them one at a time.
