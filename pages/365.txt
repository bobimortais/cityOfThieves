HISTORY
You charge the door several times before it splinters. Unfortunately, 
you injure your shoulder in the process. Lose 1 SKILL point. 
Through the broken door you see a thin, pale-skinned man with 
dark, hollow eyes, wearing a servant's uniform. In a cold, 
hissing voice he Says, 'Really, do you have to make such a 
dramatic entry? Could you not have pulled the bell cord like 
everybody else?'
