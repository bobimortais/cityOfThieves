HISTORY
She explains that she has just picked one of her golden flowers.
There are ten golden petals on the flower, and you are told 
that if dipped in dog's blood, each petal, plucked and thrown
on the ground, will change into a Gold Piece. Mrs Pipe asks for
any magic item, piece of armour or food (two  portions of your 
Provisions) in exchange for the golden flower. If you wish to trade with 
Mrs Pipe, make the necessary changes to your Adventure Sheet.
