CHOICE 1: If you win, you climb the stairs.
ACTION 1: 54
HISTORY
You scratch around in the cracks in the wall and find a loose
stone. The old man watches intently as you pull the stone out
of the wall. Peering into the hole you see an iron key. You 
place it in the lock of your cell and are amazed to feel it 
turn. Add 1 LUCK point. With the cell door open you put the 
key back in the hole in the wall and replace the stone. You 
leave your cell and pick up your sword off the table. Then 
you call out to the guards, telling them that you think they 
are stupid and that you have seen more life on a Troll's 
breakfast plate than in them. Quickly provoked, the GUARDS
rush down the stairs and are surprised to see you waiting for
them, sword drawn. You fight them one at a time.
