HISTORY
You enter small candlelit room with no windows. It is empty 
apart from a table and two chairs. A man wearing black robes 
and a skullcap is standing in  corner. He smiles and asks you
to sit down at the table. He sits opposite you and, after 
placing six white pills on top of six skulls on the table, 
looks up to you and says, 'One of the pills before you is 
deadly poisonous, the others are harmless. Swallow one of 
your choice. If you live, I give you 20 Gold Pieces. If you 
die, I keep all your possessions.'
