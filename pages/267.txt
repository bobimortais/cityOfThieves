HISTORY
The two guards holding you look at each other and then at the
other guard for a decision. He nods at them and they release 
their grip on you. As you pay him the 10 Gold Pieces he gives
you a piercing look, saying,'If Lord Azzur finds out that you
are in the city without a pass, you're as good as dead. And as
for Nicodemus, find him yourself.'
