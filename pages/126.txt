HISTORY
The little girl grabs hold of your arm and leads into a back
room. Saying nothing, she motions you to lie down on a 
sheepskin rug. Suddenly you are aware of a very old man 
sitting opposite. He rises slowly from his rocking chair and 
walks over to you. You watch transfixed as he takes hold of 
an arrow protruding from your arm and gently pulls it free 
without causing you any pain. The wound made by the arrow 
disappears before your eyes. Other arrows are treated 
similarly if you suffered more than one wound. You may restore
2 STAMINA points for each arrow pulled free by the old man. 
Then in a slow almost inaudible voice he tells you that he 
wants the broadsword that Owen Canalif gave you in payment for
the healing. You feel obliged to give him your sword, though 
reluctantly. In exchange he gives you an ordinary fighting 
sword. Reduce your SKILL score by 1.
