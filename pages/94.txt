CHOICE 1: With strength returned you feel you can now deal with Zanbar Bone and ask the little man of his whereabouts.
ACTION 1: 234
HISTORY
The little man smiles and says, 'Easy.' He reaches into his 
pocket and produces some sparkling dust which he throws up at
you. As it settles on your clothes, a feeling of strength 
surges through your body. Add 6 STAMINA points. He then tells
you that as he is feeling particularly grateful he will grant
you another wish.
