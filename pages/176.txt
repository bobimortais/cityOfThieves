HISTORY
You tell the worried bather that, despite your hatred for 
pirates, you will not harm him if he cooperates with you. You
ask him if he has any of the items that you are searching for,
but he replies that as captain of a pirate ship he does not 
need such things. You press the blade of your sword against
his fat neck to make sure he is not lying. He looks terrified
and assures you that he is telling the truth. Then he says, 
'But I do know where you can get a silver arrow. Ben Borryman
the silversmith will make anything in silver at a price. You 
will find him in Clog Street.' Making a mental note of the 
information you leave the shivering captain alone in his room,
locking the door behind you. Outside in the corridor you may 
either
