FAIL: If the number is greater than your SKILL score, the sword flies past and clatters on to the marble floor.

The lightning bolt slams into your chest and knocks you to 
the floor. Lose 3 STAMINA points. If you are still alive you 
see the fat man roaring with laughter. Perhaps he is off his 
guard? You decide to throw your sword at him from your prone 
position. Roll two dice.
