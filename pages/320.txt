HISTORY
The jolly fishwives' plump cheeks are as round and shiny as 
red apples. You ask if they own any of the items you need, but 
they all frown and shake their heads together. Then one tells
you that there is a tale that Hags have been seen disappearing
down sewers to catch for their stew-pots. However, she has 
never seen a Hag herself. You decide to leave the ladies; you
then walk back to the junction and turn left into Clog Street.
