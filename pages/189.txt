HISTORY
You take aim with your bow and fire the arrow at the Spirit 
Stalker. The arrow plunges into its chest and the agonized 
look on the face of the Spirit Stalker tells you that the 
arrow has pierced its heart. It falls to the floor, and smoke
starts to rise from its rotten flesh. Its mouth opens to release
a deafening howl that echoes around the hallway and makes you
shudder. Finally it is still, and you retrieve your silver 
arrow. You see that you are in a beautiftil marble-floored 
hallway. On three of the four walls hang portraits of 
evil-looking men and women, but on the wall hang two iron 
shields. The crest on one is a tower, and on the other a 
unicorn. A spiral staircase leads up from the centre of the 
hallway to the floor above. Will you:
