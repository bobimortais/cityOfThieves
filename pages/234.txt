HISTORY
The tiny man smiles and says, 'Ah well, if that's all you want,
then that's simple enough. He's on the fourth floor in the 
room with the black door.' Then he waves his arms at you and 
disappears in a small puff of smoke. You stand up and walk 
back down the stairs to the floor where there are two doors 
adjacent to each other on the landing.
