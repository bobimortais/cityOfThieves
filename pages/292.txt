HISTORY
You walk into a lavishly furnished room containing objets d'art 
and curios. Standing before you is a young woman dressed in a 
black silk gown. She has long black hair and bright red lips.
She smiles and motions you to sit down in one of the armchairs.
You refuse to sit down, only too aware that she is one of Zanbar
Bone's servants. She walks towards you open-armed as though 
she is about to embrace you, and when she smiles again, you see
two fang-like teeth which can only belong to a Vampire.
