HISTORY
Walking north along the street you see the entrance to a small
herbalist's shop to your left. Looking through the window you
see a wooden counter with a pair of scales upon it, and many 
sacks of different herbs crowding the floor. There is a small
archway leading out of the back of the shop to another room.
There is an 'Open' sign on the door but the shop is empty.
