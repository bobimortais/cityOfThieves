HISTORY
As you catch up with the chanting crowd, you see that they are
carrying eggs and rotten tomatoes. Soon the street opens out 
into a large market square. All round the edge are stalls with
vendors, hawkers, musicians and entertainers carrying on their 
business. In the middle of the square is an elevated pillory. 
Above the noise of the crowd a trumpet sounds and the crowd 
start to pelt the man in the pillory with rotten food. An old 
woman standing next to you two eggs to throw. Not wishing to 
appear to be an outsider, you take the eggs and hurl them. But 
as you do so, the old woman picks your pocket without you 
noticing. Lose 1 Gold Piece or any one item you may have.
