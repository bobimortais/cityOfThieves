HISTORY
Sitting down at the table the men invite you to join in their
game of pin-finger. You feel obliged to accept their challenge
and take hold of a dagger offered to you. The men tell you 
that you must stick the point of the dagger back and forth 
between your fingers into the table top as fast as you can for
a minute. If you manage not to stab yourself they will give 
you a magic item. If you do stab yourself you  must give them
5 Gold Pieces. Roll two dice.
