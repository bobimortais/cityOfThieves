HISTORY
The gaunt-faced man looks thoroughly miserable. He sees you and
shrinks back, telling you that it is not worth robbing him 
because he has no money. You tell him that you do not wish to
rob him but are seeking an old wizard named Nicodemus. He stares
at you with a surprised expression on his face and Says, 'For
2 Gold Pieces, I'll tell you Where he is.' You decide to trust
the man and pay him for his information. He pockets the gold
and says, 'You are standing on top of him! Nicodemus lives in
a hut underneath this bridge.' He throws back his head and lets
out a shrill laugh before hobbling off on his crutches, obviously
pleased with himself. You shake your head and walkover to the
steps that lead down beneath the bridge.
