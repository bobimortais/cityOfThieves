HISTORY
The glass ball shatters on impact with the cobbled sheet. On 
contact with the air the smoke turns a golden colour and begins
to take the shape of a winged helmet. The helmet solidifies 
and rests on the street, sparkling in the sunlight. Is is the 
most magnificent helmet you have ever seen.
