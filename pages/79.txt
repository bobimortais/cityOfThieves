HISTORY
Silk curtains in front of the archway are suddenly pulled 
aside and a strange creature steps into the room. It has a 
snake's head, which sits oddly atop the body of a young woman
wearing a lavish gown. Its mouth opens and a forked tongue 
darts in and out as the SERPENT QUEEN challenges you, saying, 
'Do not lie to me, scoundrel, No doubt you are and assassin 
come here to kill me. But you shall  die instead!' Suddenly 
the Serpent Queen stretches out her head and bites you on the
neck. Lose 4 STAMINA points and 1 SKILL point. If you are 
still alive, draw your sword to defend yourself.
