HISTORY
The ends at a small Shop. On the glass-paned door is painted a
sign: 'Jimmy Quicktint, Best Tattooist in Town'. A tiny bell 
rings as you push the door open and a fat man wearing purple
silk smiles in greeting. You are surprised to see that his 
arms, hands, feet and even his face are completely covered in
colourful tattoos. He grins and says, 'Practise what you 
preach!' You tell him that you require a yellow sun to be 
tattooed on your forehead with a white unicorn in the centre
of it. He replies that it is a simple task but it will cost 
you 10 Gold Pieces.
