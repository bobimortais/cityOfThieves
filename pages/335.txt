HISTORY
The larger of the Trolls tells you that you are under arrest 
for being in Port Blacksand without authorization. He tells 
you that he is feeling generous, however, and offers you a 
choice. You can pay a fine of all the gold in your backpack 
and be thrown out of the city, or spend a year with rats and 
cockroaches in a dirty dungeon cell. The other Troll bursts out
laughing, saying, 'Generous? Ho! Ho! HO! Ah, you've got such a 
sense ff humour!'
