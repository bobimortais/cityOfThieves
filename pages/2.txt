HISTORY
You remove the bracelet from your wrist and toss it at the 
monster.It lands on its annour-like shell and sticks to it 
like glue. You then watch as the bracelet starts to burn its
way through the Shell into the body of the Giant Centipede. 
Smoke rises from the neat round hole and as the bracelet
burns deeper you can see from the frantic movements of the 
Centipede that it its death throes. Finally it is still and 
you manage to squeeze yourself between its body and the roof
of the tunnel. You walk further down the tunnel, which ends 
at an iron grill through which the sewage runs.
