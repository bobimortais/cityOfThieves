HISTORY
The two guards lead you into the guardhouse and take you 
immediately downstairs to the cells below. There are four 
cells and all are empty except for one which houses a frail, 
white-haired old man. The guards unlock the cell next to the
old man's and throw you in, placing your sword on table outside. 
The only contents of the cell are a straw mattress and a pail 
of water. The guards go back upstairs and as they disappear
the old man gets up off his bed and starts to speak 'You're 
an outsider, aren't you?' Don't reply, it's obvious. Do you 
want me to set you free? Give me 10 Gold Pieces and I'll have
you out in five minutes.' The old man then puts his arm 
through the bars of your cell with the palm of his hand 
upturned.
