HISTORY
Behind you comes the sound of running feet. You look round and
see a group of town guards chasing after you. As you stop to think
where to run next, a boy runs out of a house and shouts, 
'Follow me!' You have no better plan in minds so you run after
him. The boy races down to the bottom of Mill Street and turns
left into Goose Street. He stops at a cart laden with hay and
starts to talk frantically to a kind-faced old man, saying, 
'Uncle! uncle! This brave person killed Sourbelly. We must 
help him to escape.' The old man speaks calmly to the boy, 
saying, 'Indeed we owe our friend a favour. Quick, jump into 
the cart.' You climb into the cart and cover yourself with hay. 
You lie completely motionless as you hear the running guards 
approach. They stop to speak to the old thatcher, but he sends 
them running off down Goose Street. After they are gone he 
whispers to you that he will take you to safety. You hear him
climb on to the cart and urge his horse into a slow trot. The
cart bounces noisily along the cobbled street but you feel 
comfortable in the hay. The cart stops and starts a few times,
and you hear questioning voices. About half an hour the cart 
stops again and the thatcher calls out, 'You can come out now.'
You poke your head out of the hay and are surprised to see that
you are on the edge of a wood. To the west you see the daunting
shape of Port Blacksand. You jump out of the cart and thank the
thatcher for his trouble. He says goodbye to you and wheels 
his cart round to return to Port Blacksand. Do you have all the 
items requited to slay the Night Prince, and have you been 
tattooed?
