HISTORY
You follow the old man through the swinging doors of the Hog 
and Frog tavern. He tells you to sit down at a small table in
a corner while he shuffles over to the bar to buy the drinks.
There are several shifty-looking characters sitting at nearby
tables but they do not seem interested in you. Soon the old 
man comes back to the table carrying two wooden mugs filled to 
the with cider. Once seated, he opens his leather bag and places 
two small pots on the table. He opens one and rubs the white 
cream in the pot on his wounds. He smiles and tells you that
he is a chemist by trade and that you should rub some of the 
cream on your wounds too. You take his advice and are surprised
to feel the healing effect of the cream work quickly. Add 5 
STAMINA points. After finishing your drink, you say goodbye
to the chemist, leave the tavern and head north.
