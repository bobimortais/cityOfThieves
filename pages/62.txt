HISTORY
The old wooden doors open into a dingy, smoked filled room. 
There are eight round tables in the centre of the room with 
some of the mean and shifty-looking rogues you have ever seen
sitting at them. At the back of the tavern is long wooden bar
covered with bottles and mugs. Behind the bar stands the 
innkeeper wearing a grubby apron. He is quite old, bald and 
has an ugly black scar running down his right cheek. Not all 
the customers are human. Will you:
