HISTORY
You decide that you are going to have to make a run for it or
risk being put in jail. You take 5 Gold Pieces out of your backpack
and throw them on the floor. The guards bend down to pick them
up and you run north as fast as you can. As you run off, the 
escaped murderer starts to yell and two of the guards chase
after you. In an alleyway to left you see-a large open barrel
which you dive into. You hear the guards run past but you wait
a few minutes before climbing out of the barrel. You look up 
and down Stable Street and all is clear.

Once more you set off north.
