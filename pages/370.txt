HISTORY
You place the coin in the slot and walk through the turnstile. 
Although the flowers and shrubs are not outstanding, you are 
nevertheless surprised that such a place exists in Port Blacksand.
The gardens are not large, extending back some sixty meters to
where some houses back on to them. There are two paths to 
follow, one of which runs around the edge of the gardens and 
one that leads directly into the centre, where there is some
topiary - each shrub has been cut into the shape of an animal - 
and you decide to take a closer look. The path leads into a 
paved area surrounded the by animal-shaped shrubs. In the 
middle there is a stone plinth upon which sits a large earthen
bowl containing lotus flowers! There is a painted sign which 
reads 'Do Not Pick the Flowers'. The gardener is nowhere to be
seen and there is nobody else about.
