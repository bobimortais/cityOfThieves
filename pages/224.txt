HISTORY
Sitting on a stool at the back of the shop is an old bespectacled
Dwarf. He is busy cutting a key on a cast-iron treadle machine
which squeaks and grinds noisily. You cough to get his attention,
but he does not look up from his work. Finally the machine 
comes to a halt and the Dwarf asks you what you want.
