HISTORY
Suddenly you are confronted by a small winged creature no more 
than a metre in length, hovering before you. It is red in colour
and has two horns protruding from its head and a small tail 
hanging down from its back. It will be difficult to defeat as
it flies quickly about your head spitting fire at you!
