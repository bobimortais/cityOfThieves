HISTORY
The guards lock at each other and burst out laughing. Then one
says, 'Do you think we would risk letting you in Port Blacksand
for the sake of 5  Gold Pieces? If Lord Azzur found out that 
we let you in without a pass, we would be dead men. Leys hear
no more about bribes, it's the dungeon for you.'
