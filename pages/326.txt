HISTORY
Ahead the alleyway is strewn with rubbish and discarded 
possessions. Suddenly you hear growling and you see movement 
amongst the rubbish. You draw your sword just in time as two 
WILD DOGS, each a metre and a half long, leap at you. Fight 
both clogs at the same time. Both dogs will make a separate 
attack on you in each Attack Round, but you must choose which
of the two you will fight. Attack your chosen dog as in a 
normal battle. Against the other you will throw for your 
Attack Strength in the normal way, but you will not wound it 
if your Attack Strength is greater; you must just count this 
as though you have defended yourself against its bite. 
Of course if its Attack Strength is greater, it will wound you.
