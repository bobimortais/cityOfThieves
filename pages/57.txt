HISTORY
The Dwarf jumps up off his stool, his face full of hatred. He
calls out two names loudly and two huge black dogs immediately
appear from under a table with long fangs protruding from their
slavering mouths. Wraggins points a finger at you, shouting 
'Kill the friend of Nicodemus!' and the dogs leap at you, 
barking wildly. You must fight them for your life, one at a time.
