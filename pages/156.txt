HISTORY
Standing on either side of you, the Trolls march you along 
Mill Street until you reach the city's North Gate at the 
junction with Goose Street. They tell the two guards on duty 
not to let you back into Port Blacksand. They give you a 
forceful boot up the backside and you land sprawling on the 
dusty road outside. Do you have all the items required to Slay 
the Night Prince?
