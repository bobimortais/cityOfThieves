CONGRATULATIONS
HISTORY
You leave Zanbar Bone's black tower as quickly as you can, not 
wishing to spend another moment in the infernal place. Before
leaving, however, you set it alight so that no evil entity may
ever again use it for foul deeds. You sleep the rest of the
night and long into the next morning in a hayfield, before 
setting off for Silverton in the afternoon. Battleweary and 
hungry, you arrive in Silverton the same evening. You are given
a hero's welcome and gift after gift is bestowed upon you. A 
feast is arranged and there is laughter, music and drinking in
all the streets. Finally, Owen Carralif makes a speech and 
presents you with a gold orb worth hundreds of Gold Pieces. 
The people of Silverton are joyous once again.
