HISTORY
As you reach the chest it disappears before your eyes. You 
hear laughter behind you and suddenly see in the mirror the 
hideous reflection of a black robed skeleton with green, 
translucent eyes, wearinging a golden crown on its skull. You 
spin round but it's too late. Zanbar Bone's skeletal fingers 
are touching your flesh and are draining your life. You are 
now one of his undead servants.
