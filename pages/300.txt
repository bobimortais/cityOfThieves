HISTORY
The street makes a sudden right turn and heads north. You pass 
a cluster of small houses and are aware of unseen people watching 
walk by. Then the door to one of the houses opens and a small boy 
dressed in rags runs out and hand a piece of paper. Without 
stopping, he runs off and disappears round the corner. The 
paper has a message on it which reads 'Arrows from six bows 
are pointed at you. Leave 10 Gold Pieces in the middle of the 
street and keep walking.'
