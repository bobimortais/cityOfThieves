HISTORY
The creature is outraged that you have stolen one of its 
brooches. It jumps up and you notice smoke curling up from its
nostrils as its mounts. Suddenly a blast of fire shoots from 
its jaw and it moves towards you with outstretched claws. The
blast misses you but you must fight the creature. As well as 
following the usual rules of battle, throw one die every 
Attack Round for the fiery breath. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3, it
burns you for 1 point of damage to be subtracted from your 
STAMINA. On a roll Of 4, 5 or 6 you manage to dodge the blast.
