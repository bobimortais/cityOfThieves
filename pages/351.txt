HISTORY
You take 10 Gold Pieces out of your backpack and place them on
the palm of the hand outstretched before you. The old man then 
reaches into his inner clothing and pulls out an iron key, 
telling you that it will unlock your cell. Almost in disbelief 
you take the key and place it in the lock. Incredibly, the lock 
turns. You look back at the old man and ask him if he wishes
to escape with yow. He smiles and shakes his head, saying that 
he is happy where he is. You leave the cell and, picking up your
sword, climb the stairs to the floor above. The two guards are 
relaxing over a game of cards. You wave your sword in the air
and charge at them. They grab their swords to defend themselves 
and fight you one at a time.
