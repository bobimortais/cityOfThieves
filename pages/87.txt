HISTORY
You reach the top of the ladder and peer over the handrail to
survey the ship's deck. There are two large masts rising into
the air from the deck. Wooden boxes, barrels and coils of 
rope lie all around, and one of the crew stands on guard at 
the top of the gangplank. In the centre of the deck there is 
a small cabin with an open door. Through the door you see 
stairs leading down to the lower decks.
