HISTORY
The Dwarf smiles and extends his arm you, saying, An enemy of
Nicodemus is a friend of mine. Welcome stranger'. You tell 
Wraggins that you do not know where Nicodemus lives and he 
explains that the wizard lives alone in a small hut under 
Singing Bridge, which crosses Catfish River to the old part 
of the city and harbour. He explains that the bridge is in the
middle of the city and that most streets lead to it.
